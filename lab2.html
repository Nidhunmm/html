	<p><b>IND vs WI, 2nd ODI Highlights:</b> <i>Axar Patel's unbeaten 64 off 35 balls helped India claim a thrilling two-wicket win and gain an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-game series. Sanju Samson also scored 54 off 51 deliveries, adding a 99-run partnership with Shreyas Iyer, who hit 63. Deepak Hooda further chipped in with a 33-run cameo towards the end. With six needed off the last three balls, Axar clobbered Kyle Mayers straight for a six as India scripted a sensational series-clinching win. He smashed five sixes and three fours in his unconquered knock. Earlier, West Indies posted 311 for six batting first, thanks to Shai Hope's 115 against India in the second ODI. Hope became the 10th batter and fourth West Indian to reach the mark in menâ€™s ODIs. India stand-in captain Shikhar Dhawan was the most recent batter to achieve the milestone. He had hit 109 against South Africa in 2018. Nicholas Pooran also notched up 74 to revive the innings after quick wickets of Brooks (35) and King (0). Pooran dealt in sixes, bringing his tenth half-century in ODIs in 59 balls after hitting Yuzvendra Chahal for two sixes in the 39th over of the match. A hundred-run stand between Hope-Pooran was up in 115 balls. West Indies skipper Nicholas Pooran had won the toss and elected to bat. For India, Avesh Khan made ODI debut after he was brought in place of Prasidh Krishna. WI replaced Gudakesh Motie with Hayden Walsh Jr in the playing XI after the former suffered a fractured thumb.</i> </p>
